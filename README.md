# ibm-watson-app-expert

In this project, Watson was trained to be a mobile expert. The source code in this repository was developed to communicate with Watson through command line. Some part of the code has been adapted from IBM Watson's github page - https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/python-sdk. Training and testing was done on IBM Bluemix.
